# MSc_Dissertation_PSA
This repository contains all the code used for the MSc dissertation "Using Propensity Score Analysis of Survey Data to Estimate the Effect of Social Protection on Adolescent Outcomes in Zimbabwe." The code contains all Rscript used to generate the results and figures shown within the dissertation. Different sections can be turned on or off under "Operation Toggle" as some sections take considerably longer to run and have already been calculated and hardcoded within the script later. This package was written in R package version 4.3.1, using the libraries included in the "Libraries" section. To run the code, all that is required is the 'MICS_ZWE_Data.dta' file.
